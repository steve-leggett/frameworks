Welcome to my GitHub homepage for showcasing different performance and automation frameworks. Each folder contains a self-contained project designed to demonstrate domain expertise, tooling mastery, and real-world problem-solving patterns.

## Featured Projects

### [`performance-framework-k6`](./performance-framework-k6/)
A minimal load testing framework using [k6](https://k6.io/), simulating eCommerce order workflows with configurable VUs and duration settings. Useful for backend load testing and CI/CD integration demos.

(More frameworks coming soon...)

These projects reflect my focus areas: scalable systems, real-world performance bottlenecks, and developer-first tooling that closes the feedback loop quickly.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out.
